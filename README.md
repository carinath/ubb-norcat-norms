# ubb-norcat-norms

This is a set of [normalization rules](https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Alma/Product_Documentation/010Alma_Online_Help_(English)/Metadata_Management/016Working_with_Rules/020Working_with_Normalization_Rules) (norms) for cataloging workflows in Ex Libris Alma.
Ubb-norcat-norms can be used to change bibliographic records imported from exernal resources. This set of normalization rules are customized according to RDA and Norwegian cataloging rules and language.

## What it does

## How to use ubb-norcat-norms

The norms can be used in various ways. 
For Norwegian libraries in the BIBSYS-consortia, the norms can easily be used on imported records in two ways:
1. Use the Enhance Record-function in MDE and choose "UBB-hylleklare bøker"
   or,
2. Open split mode in MDE, with the bibliographic record on the one side, choose Rules for the second window and search "UBB-hylleklare bøker". This will enable you to preview the changes before applying the norms. **(Important! Do NOT change the code directly in "UBB-hylleklare bøker"**

For libraries outside the consortia it is possible to copy the latest version from [versions](https://github.com/carinath/ubb-norcat-norms/tree/main/versions). Feel free to save a local copy and modify as needed :-)
